# movie-predictions
This was a mini-project for a Python for Data Science MOOC I did.

The course was the [edx.org course DSE200x, Python for Data Science.](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x) The assignment was to do some analysis of one of the datasets that we had used. I chose the [Movielens](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset) data set, which contains movie reviews. Although we had not learned clustering yet, we had seen it in an example, so I decided to try to apply k-means clustering to the data set to make predictions about movie ratings. 

In this repository I have included my Jupyter notebook, in which I did the analysis, as well as a stack of slides describing the problem and my approach.
