# movie-predictions
This was a mini-project for a Python for Data Science MOOC I did.

The course was the edx.org course DSE200x, Python for Data Science. The assignment was to do some analysis of one of the datasets that we had used. I chose the [Movielens data set](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which contains movie reviews. Although we had not learned clustering yet, we had seen it in an example, so I decided to try to apply k-means clustering to the data set to make predictions about movie ratings. 

In this repository I have included my Jupyter notebook, in which I did the analysis, as well as a stack of slides describing the problem and my approach.
